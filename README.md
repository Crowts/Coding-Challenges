# Coding-Challenges

This repo contains coding challenges which I taken as practice to hone my programming skills. Note that these were personal projects as I practiced Python programming from beginner to intermediate. I'm quite sure there are plenty of alternative implementations, possibly more efficient than my given solutions.
